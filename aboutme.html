        <p>I am Jorge Amaya and I am a business intelligence developer. Most of my career I have worked in a manufacturing
        company in the mining sector, with a considerable global presence. The last 5 years of my career I have spent
        developing data analysis projects, mainly for the finance departments as well as the manufacturing department. I believe
        that data is an important asset for any company that considers itself a modern and efficient company. One of the
        platforms that I have used the most recently in business intelligence is <a href="http://qlik.com/">Qlik</a>, which is an end-to-end
        development tool for data analysis projects. The platform includes the Extraction-Transformation-Loading
        process, options for visualization design, as well as data distribution tools. Previously I also spent a few
        years working with the <a href="http://SAP.com/">SAP</a> suite where I did multiple developments in its native programming language known as
        ABAP.</p> 
        <p>I am currently taking the Code Bootcamp at the University of Utah because I have the desire to learn about
        other software development tools and could give additional value to my skills around Information Technology.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I really enjoy being with my family and friends to take advantage of the outdoor activities we
        have here in Utah and surrounding areas.</p>
